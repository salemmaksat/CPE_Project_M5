--USER GUIDE--

This project is a workstation assistant to help you stay productive and healthy during your working hours. It helps you keep your distance to the screen and allows you to display whether you are bust or free.
There is an optional Pomodoro function where you can utilize the Pomodoro technique for productivity.

Upon uploading the code to your device and opening it, the main menu is activated. 
Please stick your ultrasound sensor to the bottom of your computer screen and make sure there are no extra obstacles between you and the sensor.

Pressing the left button displays 'free' while the right button displays 'busy', a display you can use when you do not want to be disturbed at work. 

Pressing the middle activates the Pomodoro. The device will display the time left and let you know when you are too close to the screen.

In the break times, you are encouraged to get up and move.

After the Pomodoro is over, the main screen is once again in effect and you may choose any function you want.



--PROJECT HISTORY--

We wanted to implement a posture corrector, but were unable to due to problems reading gyroscope data and practical issues with integrating it to an on-desk workstation.
We had problems connecting and using the ultrasound sensor but were able to resolve it with Prof. Karau's assistance.
We wish we had acquired the ultrasound sensor earlier, and that we had thought of another functionality instead of the back posture correction so that our efforts with the gyroscope could be redirected.
Overall, we are very happy with the practice we got with this project this semester and believe it will be helpful to us throughout our academic and professional careers.
